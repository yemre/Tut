Atut for linux

This is a project I developed in 1998/1999 with DJGPP, gcc 2.95 and 
allegro game library on Windows 95/98 while I was a Uni Student. 
I recently fixed/commented out stuff to compile on gcc 5.3 and I will 
eventually update it to allegro 5 to bring it back to life again with 
as litte change as possible.
